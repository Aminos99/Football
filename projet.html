<p class="are">If this is Chelsea in a new era, it seems they are heading in the same direction as their previous one - towards more success.

    Sonia Bompastor could not have hoped for a better start to life in charge when taking over from Emma Hayes.
    
    A 2-0 victory over Manchester City at Stamford Bridge lifted Chelsea above their rivals to top the table and make it 10 wins out of 10 in all competitions.
    
    Bompastor becomes the first WSL manager to win their first seven games in charge - a record she says is "there to be broken".<br>
    
    "It’s not about me," was the response from Bompastor afterwards but there was no hiding her enjoyment as the full-time whistle was blown in London.
    
    "When you are on the touchline as a manager you have a lot of emotions - sometimes frustration, sometimes happiness," said Bompastor.
    
    "When I saw the two great goals, I really enjoyed it. I know how difficult it is to score against a really good Manchester City team.
    
    "I just wanted to enjoy it. You don't get that many opportunities in these great environments to get a victory and a clean sheet against Manchester City - one of the best teams in Europe.
    
    "Everything is almost perfect. If you don't enjoy it now, you will never enjoy it."</p>
